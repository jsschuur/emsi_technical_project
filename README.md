The purpose of this program is to stream the data from sample.gz and compile it into a sqlite database along with preforming a few tertiary calculations.

The entirety of the program can be found in app.py

the app can be run by opening a terminal in the directory of app.py and executing the command ```python3 app.py```
    1. Open a terminal
    2. Navigate to the directory that contains app.py
    3. run '''python3 app.py'''

the database should not exist in the directory of the program prior to execution
